# github-actions-quickstart
CIS 350 HW2

Feedback: 

The documentation was helpful but I think that step 4 could be a little more clear. There was nowhere to scroll down when creating the file, and I had to press committ changes before seeing the screen that was shown in the documentation. Additionally, GitHub prompted me to make a pull request after I made the new branch, and since I didn't know what I was doing, I created the request and merged the files. This caused the workflow to not get setup correctly, so when I went to GitHub actions I didn't see anything. I had to redo the process because of this mistake, so I think a little more clairty here could be beneficial.
